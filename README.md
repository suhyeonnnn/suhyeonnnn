## 👋 Hi, I'm Suhyun Lee  
**Bioinformatics & AI Engineer (in progress)**  
Interested in **Protein Design, AI-driven Biology, Machine Learning, and Retrieval-based AI systems.**

I enjoy building **end-to-end AI pipelines** — data preprocessing → retrieval → model integration → deployment.  
Recently, I’ve been expanding into **Protein Modeling & BioAI.**
